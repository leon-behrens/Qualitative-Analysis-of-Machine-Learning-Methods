# Qualitative Analysis of Machine Learning Methods

## Project Overview
The goal of this Projektarbeit is to gain a deeper understanding of neural network models and convolutional network models, as well as comparing results from multi-task learning-by-confusion methods for fast detection of phase transitions.

Key objectives include:
1. Creating an image dataset using Stable Diffusion.
2. Analyzing the generated dataset using the learning-by-confusion scheme.
3. Generating additional datasets for comparison by:
   - Adjusting the existing prompts in 2D.
   - Creating new prompts.
   - Using different architectures.
