The goal of this Projektarbeit is to gain a deeper understanding of neural network models and convolutional network models as well as comparing results from multi-task 
learning-by-confusion-methods by fast detection of phase transition. Firstly, an image dataset using Stable DiEusion will be created. This multi-task generated image dataset w
ill be analyzed by the learning-by-confusion scheme. Furthermore, additional datasets will be created for comparison which will be done either adjusting the existing prompt in 2D, 
creating a new prompt or use diEerent architectures.
